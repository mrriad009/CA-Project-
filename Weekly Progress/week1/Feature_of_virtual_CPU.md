# Virtual CPU Emulator

The virtual CPU emulates a simplified version of a real CPU, focusing on fundamental operations. Below is a comprehensive feature outline:

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

- **Arithmetic Instructions**: Basic math operations like `ADD` and `SUB`, allowing the virtual CPU to perform addition and subtraction.
- **Data Transfer Instructions**: Instructions like `LOAD` and `STORE` to transfer data between memory and registers.
- **Control Flow Instructions**: Branching instructions like `JUMP` and conditional instructions to allow the execution of loops and conditional operations.
- **I/O Instructions**: Basic I/O operations to simulate reading from and writing to input/output devices.

## Core CPU Components

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, AND, OR).
- **Registers**: Temporary storage locations within the CPU for quick data access.
- **Program Counter**: Keeps track of the current instruction being executed.
- **Instruction Register**: Holds the currently executing instruction.
- **Memory Management**: Simulates a basic memory model to store and retrieve data and instructions.

## Additional Features

- **Basic Pipelining**: Implements a simple pipeline to demonstrate CPU instruction parallelism.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Allows the CPU to respond to external events or instructions by interrupting the current process.
- **Subroutine Calls**: Supports subroutines for better code modularity, allowing programs to call and return from functions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Basic optimizations to increase the CPU emulatorâ€™s performance.
