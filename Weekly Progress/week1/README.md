1. **Defining the Project Scope**  
   - Establishing the emulator's goals and limitations.
   - Setting up a clear roadmap for future development.

2. **Outlining Key Features**  
   - Identifying essential functionalities that the emulator must support (register management, instruction decoding, etc.).

3. **Choosing Programming Language and Tools**  
   - Selecting a suitable programming language.
   - Identifying necessary tools for development, such as debuggers and profilers.

4. **Setting Up the Development Environment**  
   - Configuring an environment with all required dependencies.
   - Integrating **version control** ( Git) for collaborative development and version tracking.
