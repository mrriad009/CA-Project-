## Programming Language & Tools

We will use **C++** for this project due to its:

- **Low-Level Memory Control**: C++ provides fine-grained memory management, which is helpful in simulating the CPUâ€™s internal structure and managing simulated memory directly.
- **Performance**: As a compiled language, C++ is fast, which is beneficial for running and testing complex simulations.

## Development Environment and Tools

- **Visual Studio Code** or **CLion**: Lightweight, flexible, and powerful IDEs suitable for C++ development. Visual Studio Code also has extensive plugin support for Git and debugging.
- **GitHub**: For version control, collaboration, and documentation storage. Using GitHub will allow team members to contribute together, review changes, and maintain different versions.
- **Git**: Command-line tool for managing version control.
- **G++ Compiler**: For Visual Studio Code, ensure that the G++ compiler is installed for compiling C++ code.
