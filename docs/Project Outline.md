# Project Outline: Virtual CPU Emulator

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a virtual CPU emulator, replicating basic CPU functionality, including instruction execution, memory management, and I/O operations.

## Project Goals
- To implement a basic instruction set architecture (ISA) with standard operations.
- To simulate core CPU components, including an ALU, registers, program counter, and memory management.
- To support basic I/O operations.
- To optimize performance through pipelining and other techniques.

## Key Features
- **Instruction Set**: Basic instructions for arithmetic, data transfer, and control flow.
- **ALU**: Arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Registers**: General-purpose registers.
- **Program Counter**: Tracks the current instruction.
- **Memory Management**: Simulated memory for data storage.
- **Input/Output**: Emulated keyboard and display operations.

## Technology and Tools
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Documentation**: Markdown and PPT
