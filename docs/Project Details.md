## Weekly Tasks

### **Week 1: Project Planning & Setup**
**Objective**: Define project scope, gather resources, and set up the development environment.  
**Tasks**:
- Outline the features of the virtual CPU.
- Choose a programming language (Python/C++) and tools.
- Set up version control (e.g., GitHub).

---

### **Week 2: Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**
**Objective**: Design the ISA for the virtual CPU.  
**Tasks**:
- Define basic instructions (ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE, etc.).
- Document the instruction formats.
- Create a simple assembler to convert assembly code into machine code.

---

### **Week 3: Basic CPU Components**
**Objective**: Implement core components of the CPU.  
**Tasks**:
- Build the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).
- Implement general-purpose registers.
- Create the program counter and instruction register.

---

### **Week 4: Instruction Execution**
**Objective**: Develop the instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle.  
**Tasks**:
- Implement the instruction fetching mechanism.
- Decode instructions and execute them using the ALU and registers.
- Test with simple programs.

---

### **Week 5: Memory Management**
**Objective**: Implement memory management for the virtual CPU.  
**Tasks**:
- Set up a simulated memory space.
- Implement memory read/write operations.
- Handle address mapping and memory segmentation.

---

### **Week 6: I/O Operations**
**Objective**: Enable basic input/output operations.  
**Tasks**:
- Implement simulated I/O devices (keyboard, display).
- Create I/O instructions and integrate them with the CPU.
- Test with I/O-intensive programs.

---

### **Week 7: Advanced Features**
**Objective**: Add advanced CPU features.  
**Tasks**:
- Implement branching and control flow instructions.
- Add support for subroutines and interrupts.
- Integrate a simple pipeline mechanism.

---

### **Week 8: Performance Optimization**
**Objective**: Optimize the emulator for better performance.  
**Tasks**:
- Profile the emulator to identify bottlenecks.
- Optimize critical code paths.
- Enhance the assembler for better instruction encoding.

---

### **Week 9: Final Testing & Debugging**
**Objective**: Thoroughly test and debug the emulator.  
**Tasks**:
- Test with a variety of assembly programs.
- Debug and fix any issues.
- Validate performance against benchmarks.

---

### **Week 10: Documentation & Presentation**
**Objective**: Document the project and prepare for presentation.  
**Tasks**:
- Write comprehensive documentation.
- Prepare a project report and presentation slides.
- Conduct a demo session.
